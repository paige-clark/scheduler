## Interview Scheduler
This project was built to explore creating a single page app with React.

Interview Scheduler is an app that allows a user to browser appointments by day, read the details of appointments, edit existing appointments, add new appointments, and delete existing appointments.

I learned a lot about React and different testing frameworks during the creation of this project, I really like the modularity of the React workflow!

## Tools Used
- React
- Webpack, Babel
- Axios, WebSockets

- Storybook, Webpack Dev Server, Jest, Testing - Library
